## How it Works

The LionHunting EA MT4 utilizes the following steps in its trading algorithm:

1. **Initialization**: In the `OnInit()` function, the account balance and risk tolerance percentage are retrieved. The stop loss and take profit levels are calculated based on the current symbol bid/ask prices and the risk tolerance.
2. **Deinitialization**: In the `OnDeinit()` function, any open trades are closed before the expert advisor is removed from the chart.
3. **Tick Processing**: In the `OnTick()` function, the expert advisor loops through all currency pairs and checks the trading conditions for each pair.
4. **Trading Conditions**: The `CheckTradingConditions()` function is called to determine if the current candlestick pattern and price level meet the predefined trading conditions.
5. **Trade Execution**: If the trading conditions are met, the `ExecuteTrade()` function is called to execute a trade according to the predefined parameters, such as trade type, volume, price, stop loss, and take profit.
6. **Position Sizing**: The `CalculatePositionSize()` function calculates the position size based on the risk tolerance and account balance, taking into account the difference between the entry price and stop loss level.
7. **Candlestick Pattern Recognition**: The `CandlestickPattern()` function can be further implemented to recognize specific candlestick patterns for trading signals.
8. **Support and Resistance Levels**: The `SupportLevel()` and `ResistanceLevel()` functions can be customized to calculate the support and resistance levels based on the specific trading strategy.
